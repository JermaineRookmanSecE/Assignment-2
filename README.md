For my assignment 2, the website I created for an imagianry company is a barbershop called Reflections. The websites opens a title, a navigation bar that will bring you to the multiple pages of the website and a
image of the website logo that slides in to catch the users eye. I used a card to display on the homepage of the website a bunch of different hairstyles that look good plus an animation using keyframes to draw their 
attention to them. Afterwards the user is shown a video of different haircuts which will help them possibly pick their style when browsing.

One of the nav choices is to the appointment selection, I used 3 seperate cards to present the users with a selection of 3 barbers that have different times they are available to work, I used <select> to
give the user the ability to select from the 3 different barbers, the day they would like to show up and the exact time from the opening hours.

For the CSS styling I took inspiration from the company logo of white and gray by keep the background white while having the <cards> and other small elements have a similar gray shading to keep up with the overall theme
I made the cards small enough to be able to be placed next to eachother for coherance and kept to the 'R' in the company logo by making all of the text match its black colour font. 

Lastly I utilized media querys to have the website images be stacked properly when scrolling on smaller devices whether it be your phone or your tablet, to allow the website to be readable when on smaller devices.
